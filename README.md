# horiseon-seo-hw-1

## Summary

This project is intended to fulfill the consumer's request, which was to refactor the code of their webpage to meet accessibility standards and optimize it for search engines. In addition to optimizing the webpage for search engines, I also consolidated the code to run more effeciently, reorganized the code, and marked the code with comments to describe what is going on.

I was motivated to do this project to learn about the processes of optimizing website accesibility to make them more visible for search engines. One of the key lessons I have taken from working on this project was the usage of numerous tags other than "div." Rather than wrap every item inside a of "div," I could, for example, use the tag "footer" when specifically targeting the footer of the webpage. These "semantics" are necessary for marking the relevancy of the content for the search engines.

## Criteria

I had to adjust the code to meet certain accessibility standards to make the webpage optimal for search engines. These standards include:

* Semantic HTML elements
    * Header
    * Footer
    * Main
    * Article
    * Aside
* Accessible alt attributes
* Clear, concise title

In addition to these SEO accessibility standards, I also had to:
* Make sure the links properly function
* Consolidate the CSS code
* Properly comment in code
